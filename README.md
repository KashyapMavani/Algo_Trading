This project aims to predict market trends (bullish or bearish) for the stock or crypto market using an algorithm based on simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA). This algorithm can potentially make live market predictions. It's integrated with a Telegram bot, so when the algorithm detects a trend, it will notify users on the Telegram app with the current bullish or bearish market level.
